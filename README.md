> Reduced mobility : I've also created "Reduced mobility" folder because some of my traces can be hiked with disabled (wheelchair) peoples ... Find out inside /extras/

> Extras : Check out this folder to find European long-distance paths and also "GR" hikes of France.

### How to use : 
You can download freely the GPX track and also his topographic map attachment. You're always gonna find the duo of two files (png/gpx) to understand what's the hike except.

### Be informed
Always be careful and plan ahead when hiking. I could not be held responsible in the event of an accident or any inconvenience occurring on your hike. My tracks pass through private properties which can cause you legal problems later. Figure it out.
